# asillav.github.io — Portfolio (GIF-only demo)

This package is ready for GitHub Pages. It uses a GIF-only demo inside the project card.

## Upload steps
1. Create a public repo named `asillav.github.io`.
2. Upload these files at the repo root.
3. Put your assets in `assets/`:
   - `logo.png` (transparent background)
   - `csv-analyzer.gif` (your project demo)
4. Enable Pages: Settings → Pages → Branch `main`, Folder `/ (root)`.
5. Visit `https://asillav.github.io`.

## Notes
- Keep the GIF under ~8–10 MB for faster load.
- If later you want an MP4 preview, replace the media block in `index.html` with a `<video>` snippet.
